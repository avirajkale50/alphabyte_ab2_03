## Rescue Breathing: A First Aid Guide

**1. Definition and Symptoms**

**Definition:** Rescue breathing, also known as mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, is a first aid procedure used to provide oxygen to a person who is not breathing or is not breathing effectively. This technique is performed to manually deliver air into the lungs when spontaneous respiration has ceased or is inadequate to sustain life. It is often a crucial component of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

**Symptoms Indicating the Need for Rescue Breathing:**

*   **Absence of breathing:** The person is not exhibiting any chest rise or fall, and no air is felt or heard coming from their nose or mouth. This is typically determined by observing the person for no more than 10 seconds.
*   **Gasping or Agonal Breathing:** Irregular, infrequent gasps, often described as "fish out of water" breathing, are not considered effective breathing and require intervention.
*   **Severe Respiratory Distress:** While not a complete cessation of breathing, symptoms of severe respiratory distress indicating imminent respiratory failure may warrant rescue breathing. These symptoms include:
    *   Bluish skin discoloration (cyanosis), particularly around the lips and fingertips.
    *   Extreme difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.
    *   Using accessory muscles of respiration (neck muscles, intercostal muscles) to breathe.
    *   Altered level of consciousness, ranging from drowsiness to unresponsiveness.
    *   Nasal flaring (especially in infants and children).
    *   Retractions (the skin around the ribs and sternum pulls inward during breathing).

**Important Note:**  Always prioritize your own safety and assess the scene for potential hazards before approaching the victim.

**2. When to Seek Emergency Medical Help**

Emergency medical help (call 911 or your local emergency number) should be activated **IMMEDIATELY** if a person exhibits any of the symptoms described above.  Delegate someone to call emergency services while you begin first aid. If you are alone, call emergency services yourself before initiating rescue breathing, if possible.  Use the speakerphone function if necessary.

Inform the emergency dispatcher of the following:

*   Your location (be as specific as possible).
*   The nature of the emergency (person is not breathing/difficulty breathing).
*   The victim's condition (conscious/unconscious).
*   Any known medical history (if available).
*   Your name and phone number.

**3. Step-by-Step First Aid Procedures**

**A. Ensure Scene Safety and Personal Protection:**

*   Assess the scene for any dangers (e.g., traffic, fire, hazardous materials, electrical hazards).
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), such as gloves, if available, to minimize the risk of infection.

**B. Check for Responsiveness:**

*   Tap or gently shake the person and shout, "Are you okay?"
*   If there is no response, proceed to the next step.

**C. Activate Emergency Medical Services (EMS):**

*   If you haven't already, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately.
*   If possible, delegate this task to another person.

**D. Check for Breathing and Pulse (Simultaneously, for no more than 10 seconds):**

*   Look for chest rise and fall.
*   Listen for breath sounds near the person's mouth and nose.
*   Feel for air movement on your cheek.
*   Simultaneously, check for a pulse, preferably at the carotid artery (neck).  Locate the Adam's apple, then slide your fingers into the groove beside it.

**E. Begin Rescue Breathing (If No Breathing but Pulse Present):**

*   **Open the Airway:**  Use the head-tilt/chin-lift maneuver. Place one hand on the person's forehead and gently tilt their head back.  Place the fingers of your other hand under the bony part of their chin and lift the chin forward. *Avoid tilting the head back if you suspect a spinal injury. In this case, use the jaw-thrust maneuver: place your fingers behind the angles of the jaw and lift the jaw forward.  This may require two rescuers.*
*   **Seal the Airway:** Pinch the person's nose closed with your thumb and forefinger.
*   **Give Breaths:** Take a normal breath. Place your mouth tightly over the person's mouth, creating a tight seal. Give two initial breaths, each lasting about 1 second, and watch for the chest to rise.  If the chest doesn't rise, recheck the airway and try again.
*   **Continue Breathing:** Give one breath every 5-6 seconds (approximately 10-12 breaths per minute).  Ensure the chest rises with each breath.
*   **Reassess:** After every 2 minutes (approximately 24 breaths), recheck for breathing and pulse for no more than 10 seconds. If there is still no breathing but a pulse is present, continue rescue breathing.

**F. Begin CPR (If No Breathing and No Pulse):**

*   If there is no breathing and no pulse, immediately begin CPR. CPR involves chest compressions and rescue breaths. Follow the guidelines of a certified CPR course.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Infants and Children:** The technique is similar, but use smaller breaths (puff cheeks only) and cover both the mouth and nose of an infant with your mouth.  The rate is also faster - approximately 1 breath every 3 seconds (20 breaths per minute).
*   **Stoma Breathing:** If the person has a stoma (surgical opening in the neck), breathe directly into the stoma, sealing the mouth and nose if possible.
*   **Vomiting:** If the person vomits, turn them onto their side (if no suspected spinal injury) to prevent aspiration. Clear the airway of any vomit before resuming rescue breathing.
*   **Barrier Devices:**  If available, use a pocket mask or face shield to reduce the risk of infection.

**4. Home Remedies and Self-Care Tips**

Rescue breathing is an emergency procedure, not a home remedy.  It is a critical intervention required when someone is not breathing. There are no applicable home remedies or self-care tips that replace the need for immediate and proper rescue breathing in these circumstances.

**Post-incident:**

*   **For the rescuer:** Seek emotional support. Witnessing or performing rescue breathing can be stressful. Talking to a counselor or trusted friend can be helpful. Consider taking a CPR certification course to improve skills and confidence.
*   **For the patient (after medical care):** Focus on recovery as directed by healthcare professionals. This may include respiratory therapy, medication, and lifestyle adjustments.

**5. Prevention Measures**

While rescue breathing is a response to an emergency, many situations requiring it are preventable.

*   **Learn CPR:** The best prevention is to be prepared. Take a certified CPR and first aid course from a reputable organization like the American Heart Association or the American Red Cross.  Maintain your certification with regular refresher courses.
*   **Water Safety:** Supervise children closely near water. Teach children to swim and to be aware of water hazards. Use appropriate flotation devices.
*   **Choking Prevention:**  Cut food into small pieces for young children and elderly individuals. Supervise children while eating. Learn the Heimlich maneuver.
*   **Smoke Detectors:** Install and maintain working smoke detectors in your home.  Test them monthly.
*   **Carbon Monoxide Detectors:** Install and maintain working carbon monoxide detectors.
*   **Fall Prevention:** Make your home safe to prevent falls, especially for elderly individuals.  Remove tripping hazards, use grab bars in bathrooms, and ensure adequate lighting.
*   **Drug Overdose Awareness:**  Be aware of the signs and symptoms of drug overdose. If someone is suspected of overdosing, call emergency services immediately and administer naloxone if available and trained to do so.
*   **Medical Conditions:** Ensure individuals with respiratory conditions (e.g., asthma, COPD) have appropriate medication and a management plan in place.
*   **Allergy Awareness:**  Be aware of allergies and carry epinephrine auto-injectors (EpiPens) if prescribed.
