## First Aid Guide: Burns

This guide provides information on how to administer first aid for burns. It is not a substitute for professional medical advice. Always seek medical attention when necessary.

**1. Definition and Symptoms**

A burn is tissue damage resulting from heat, electricity, radiation, or chemicals. Burns are classified by depth and severity:

*   **First-Degree Burns (Superficial):** Affect only the epidermis (outer skin layer).
    *   **Symptoms:** Redness, pain, mild swelling. Skin is dry and may feel warm to the touch. Blisters are generally absent.
*   **Second-Degree Burns (Partial Thickness):** Affect the epidermis and part of the dermis (underlying skin layer).
    *   **Symptoms:** Redness, pain, swelling, and blisters. Skin may appear wet or weeping.
*   **Third-Degree Burns (Full Thickness):** Destroy the epidermis and dermis. May affect underlying tissues, including fat, muscle, and bone.
    *   **Symptoms:** Skin may appear white, charred, leathery, or waxy. May be painless due to nerve damage. Surrounding areas may have first or second-degree burns.
*   **Fourth-Degree Burns:** Extend beyond the skin and involve deeper tissues such as tendons, ligaments, muscle, and bone.
    *   **Symptoms:** Similar to third-degree burns but extend deeper. Charring is common. There may be loss of body parts.

**Common Symptoms of Burns (regardless of degree):**

*   Pain (may be absent in deep burns due to nerve damage)
*   Redness
*   Swelling
*   Blisters (second-degree burns)
*   Shock (in severe cases)
*   Dehydration
*   Infection

**2. When to Seek Emergency Medical Help**

Seek immediate medical attention for any of the following:

*   **Third- or Fourth-Degree Burns:** Regardless of size or location.
*   **Second-Degree Burns:** Larger than 3 inches (7.5 cm) in diameter, or located on the face, hands, feet, genitals, or major joints.
*   **Burns that encircle an entire limb or body part.**
*   **Electrical burns:** Even if there are no obvious external injuries, internal damage may be extensive.
*   **Chemical burns:** Especially if the chemical is unknown or the burn is extensive.
*   **Inhalation burns:** Signs include difficulty breathing, coughing, hoarseness, singed nasal hairs, or facial burns.
*   **Burns in Infants or Elderly Individuals:** Due to their increased vulnerability.
*   **Burns in Individuals with Pre-existing Medical Conditions:** Such as diabetes, heart disease, or a weakened immune system.
*   **Any burn that is accompanied by signs of infection:** Increasing pain, redness, swelling, pus drainage, or fever.
*   **If the victim is unresponsive or has altered mental status.**

**CALL EMERGENCY SERVICES IMMEDIATELY (e.g., 911 in the US and Canada, 999 in the UK, 112 in Europe) for severe burns or if you are unsure about the severity.**

**3. Step-by-Step First Aid Procedures**

The following steps apply to minor burns (first-degree and small, uncomplicated second-degree burns):

1.  **Stop the Burning Process:**
    *   **Remove the person from the source of the burn.**
    *   **Extinguish flames using water, a blanket, or by rolling the person on the ground.**
    *   **Remove any smoldering or hot clothing or jewelry, unless it is stuck to the skin.** If stuck, cut around it.
2.  **Cool the Burn:**
    *   **Immediately run cool (not cold) water over the burn for 10-20 minutes.** This is the most important step.
    *   If clean running water isn't available, immerse the burn in cool water or apply cool, wet compresses.
3.  **Cover the Burn:**
    *   **Loosely cover the burn with a sterile, non-adhesive bandage or clean cloth.** Do not apply cotton wool, as it can stick to the burn.
4.  **Pain Relief:**
    *   **Administer over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, as needed, following package instructions.**
5.  **Blisters:**
    *   **Small, intact blisters are best left alone.** If a blister breaks, gently clean the area with soap and water, apply an antibiotic ointment, and cover with a sterile bandage.
6.  **Elevate:**
    *   **If possible, elevate the burned area to reduce swelling.**

**Important Considerations for Specific Situations:**

*   **Electrical Burns:** Before approaching the victim, ensure the power source is turned off. Do not touch the victim if they are still in contact with the electrical source. Monitor for breathing and pulse. Be prepared to administer CPR if necessary.
*   **Chemical Burns:** Immediately flush the affected area with copious amounts of cool water for at least 20 minutes (or longer if directed by the chemical's safety data sheet [SDS]). Remove contaminated clothing and jewelry while flushing. If the chemical is a dry powder, brush it off before flushing. Contact poison control.
*   **Inhalation Burns:** Move the person to fresh air. Monitor for breathing difficulties. Seek immediate medical attention.

**What NOT to Do:**

*   **Do not apply ice directly to the burn.** This can cause further tissue damage.
*   **Do not apply butter, oil, grease, or other home remedies.** These can trap heat and increase the risk of infection.
*   **Do not break blisters unless they are very large or painful.**
*   **Do not remove clothing that is stuck to the skin.**
*   **Do not use antiseptic sprays or ointments on large burns.** These can interfere with healing and make it difficult for medical professionals to assess the burn.

**4. Home Remedies and Self-Care Tips**

These tips are applicable *only* for minor burns after initial first aid:

*   **Keep the burn clean and dry.** Change the bandage daily.
*   **Apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment (such as bacitracin or neomycin) to prevent infection.** However, discontinue use if a rash develops, as some people are allergic.
*   **Use aloe vera gel to soothe the skin and promote healing.** Pure aloe vera gel can be applied several times a day.
*   **Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids.**
*   **Protect the burn from sunlight.** Cover the area with clothing or use sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher) after the burn has healed.
*   **Monitor for signs of infection:** increased pain, redness, swelling, pus drainage, or fever. Seek medical attention if infection is suspected.
*   **Use over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream for itching (if applicable, consult a doctor before using on open wounds).**

**5. Prevention Measures**

Preventing burns is crucial:

*   **Smoke Detectors:** Install and maintain working smoke detectors on every level of your home. Test them monthly.
*   **Water Heater Temperature:** Set your water heater to 120°F (49°C) or lower to prevent scalding.
*   **Cooking Safety:**
    *   Keep pot handles turned inward to prevent spills.
    *   Never leave cooking unattended.
    *   Use caution when cooking with hot oil or grease.
    *   Keep flammable materials away from the stove.
*   **Fire Safety:**
    *   Never leave candles unattended.
    *   Keep matches and lighters out of reach of children.
    *   Have a fire extinguisher readily available and know how to use it.
    *   Plan and practice a fire escape route.
*   **Electrical Safety:**
    *   Have electrical wiring inspected regularly.
    *   Repair or replace damaged electrical cords and appliances.
    *   Do not overload electrical outlets.
    *   Use ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) in bathrooms and kitchens.
*   **Chemical Safety:**
    *   Store chemicals in their original containers, clearly labeled, and out of reach of children and pets.
    *   Wear appropriate protective gear (gloves, eye protection) when handling chemicals.
*   **Sun Safety:**
    *   Wear protective clothing, sunglasses, and a wide-brimmed hat when outdoors.
    *   Apply sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher liberally and reapply every two hours, especially after swimming or sweating.
    *   Avoid prolonged sun exposure during peak hours (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.).
*   **Child Safety:**
    *   Keep hot liquids, food, and objects out of reach of children.
    *   Supervise children closely when they are near potential burn hazards.
    *   Teach children about fire safety and burn prevention.
    *   Use stove guards to prevent children from reaching hot burners.
