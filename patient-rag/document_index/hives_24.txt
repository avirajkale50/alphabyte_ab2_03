## First Aid Guide: Hives (Urticaria)

**1. Definition and Symptoms:**

**Definition:** Hives, also known as urticaria, are raised, itchy welts on the skin. They can vary in size and appear anywhere on the body. Hives are usually a reaction to an allergen, but can also be caused by stress, infection, or other factors. The welts occur due to histamine release, causing fluid leakage from small blood vessels in the skin.

**Symptoms:**

*   **Welts (Wheals):** Raised, pink or red patches of skin, often with a pale center.
*   **Itching:** Intense itching (pruritus) is the most common symptom.
*   **Swelling:** Swelling can occur around the hives, particularly in the lips, tongue, eyelids, or throat (angioedema).
*   **Size and Shape Variability:** Hives can be small or large, round or irregular.
*   **Transient Nature:** Individual hives typically resolve within 24 hours, but new ones may appear, leading to a fluctuating pattern.
*   **Dermatographism:** In some cases, hives can be triggered by scratching the skin. This is known as dermatographism or "skin writing."
*   **Possible Associated Symptoms:** Depending on the underlying cause, hives may be accompanied by other symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or fever.

**2. When to Seek Emergency Medical Help:**

It is crucial to seek immediate medical attention if hives are accompanied by any of the following symptoms, as they may indicate a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis):

*   **Difficulty Breathing:** Wheezing, shortness of breath, or feeling like the throat is closing.
*   **Swelling of the Tongue, Lips, or Throat (Angioedema):** This can obstruct the airway.
*   **Dizziness or Lightheadedness:** May indicate a drop in blood pressure.
*   **Fainting or Loss of Consciousness:**
*   **Rapid Heartbeat:**
*   **Confusion:**
*   **Nausea, Vomiting, or Diarrhea:** Especially if severe.
*   **Sudden Change in Voice:** Hoarseness.
*   **Feeling of Impending Doom:** A strong sense that something is seriously wrong.

**If any of these symptoms are present, call emergency services (e.g., 911 in the US) or go to the nearest emergency room immediately.**  Do not attempt to manage these symptoms at home. If the individual has a prescribed epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen), administer it immediately according to instructions and still seek emergency medical attention.

**3. Step-by-Step First Aid Procedures (for Mild to Moderate Hives without Anaphylaxis Symptoms):**

**a) Assess the Situation:**

*   Ensure the individual is conscious and breathing normally.
*   Check for any signs of anaphylaxis (see Section 2). If present, activate emergency medical services.
*   Try to identify any potential triggers for the hives (e.g., recent food eaten, medication taken, insect sting).

**b) Remove the Trigger (If Possible):**

*   If the hives are suspected to be caused by an insect sting, carefully remove the stinger using a firm edge (like a credit card) to scrape it away. Avoid squeezing the venom sac.
*   If the hives are related to contact with an irritant, wash the affected area thoroughly with mild soap and water.
*   If the hives are suspected to be caused by a medication, consult with a healthcare professional before discontinuing the medication.

**c) Relieve Itching:**

*   **Cool Compress:** Apply a cool, wet compress or ice pack wrapped in a cloth to the affected areas for 10-15 minutes at a time.
*   **Cool Shower or Bath:** A cool shower or bath can provide temporary relief from itching.  Avoid hot water, as it can worsen the itching.
*   **Loose-Fitting Clothing:** Wear loose, comfortable clothing made of breathable fabrics like cotton to minimize irritation.

**d) Administer Antihistamines (Over-the-Counter):**

*   **First-Generation Antihistamines (e.g., Diphenhydramine [Benadryl]):**  These medications are effective at relieving itching but can cause drowsiness. Follow dosage instructions carefully.  Note contraindications (e.g., glaucoma, enlarged prostate).
*   **Second-Generation Antihistamines (e.g., Cetirizine [Zyrtec], Loratadine [Claritin], Fexofenadine [Allegra]):** These medications are less likely to cause drowsiness. Follow dosage instructions carefully.

**e) Monitor Symptoms:**

*   Observe the individual for any worsening of symptoms or the development of new symptoms.
*   If symptoms persist for more than 24 hours despite home treatment, or if they worsen, seek medical advice from a doctor or urgent care clinic.

**4. Home Remedies and Self-Care Tips:**

*   **Avoid Scratching:** Scratching can worsen the itching and inflammation, potentially leading to skin damage and infection.
*   **Colloidal Oatmeal Bath:**  Adding colloidal oatmeal to a lukewarm bath can help soothe the skin and relieve itching.
*   **Baking Soda Paste:** A paste made of baking soda and water can be applied to the affected areas to relieve itching.
*   **Aloe Vera Gel:**  Apply pure aloe vera gel to soothe irritated skin.
*   **Avoid Irritants:** Minimize exposure to known irritants such as harsh soaps, detergents, perfumes, and certain fabrics (e.g., wool).
*   **Stress Management:** Stress can sometimes trigger or worsen hives. Practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga.
*   **Identify and Avoid Triggers:** Keep a food diary, medication list, and note any potential triggers to help identify the cause of the hives.
*   **Keep Cool:**  Avoid overheating, as excessive sweating can worsen itching.
*   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water to keep the skin hydrated.

**5. Prevention Measures:**

*   **Allergy Testing:** If hives are frequent or severe, consider undergoing allergy testing to identify specific allergens.
*   **Avoid Known Allergens:** Once allergens are identified, take steps to avoid them.
*   **Read Food Labels Carefully:**  Be vigilant about reading food labels to avoid hidden allergens.
*   **Inform Healthcare Professionals:**  Inform doctors and dentists about any known allergies before receiving medications or treatments.
*   **Carry an Epinephrine Auto-Injector (If Prescribed):** If you have a history of severe allergic reactions, carry an epinephrine auto-injector and know how to use it.
*   **Avoid Insect Stings:** Use insect repellent, wear long sleeves and pants when outdoors, and avoid areas with high insect activity.
*   **Choose Fragrance-Free Products:** Opt for fragrance-free soaps, detergents, and lotions to minimize skin irritation.
*   **Maintain a Healthy Lifestyle:** A healthy diet, regular exercise, and adequate sleep can help strengthen the immune system and reduce the risk of hives.
*   **Manage Stress:** Practice stress-reducing techniques.
