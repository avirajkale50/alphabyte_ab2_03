This guide provides general first aid information for common medical emergencies and ailments. **It is NOT a substitute for professional medical advice. Always seek professional medical attention when necessary.**

**I. Bleeding (Wound Management)**

**1. Definition and Symptoms:**

*   **Definition:** Loss of blood from the circulatory system due to a broken blood vessel.
*   **Symptoms:** Visible blood flow (external bleeding), signs of internal bleeding may include:
    *   Lightheadedness or dizziness
    *   Weakness
    *   Shortness of breath
    *   Abdominal pain or swelling
    *   Blood in vomit or stool
    *   Pale or clammy skin
    *   Increasing heart rate

**2. When to Seek Emergency Medical Help:**

*   Uncontrollable bleeding (blood spurting out)
*   Deep wounds
*   Wounds involving the head, chest, or abdomen
*   Signs of internal bleeding
*   Wound contaminated with dirt or debris that cannot be easily removed
*   Animal bites
*   Suspected fracture near the wound
*   If bleeding doesn't stop after 10-15 minutes of direct pressure

**3. Step-by-Step First Aid Procedures:**

*   **Ensure safety:** Wear gloves if available to avoid exposure to bodily fluids.
*   **Apply Direct Pressure:** Use a clean cloth or sterile dressing to apply direct, firm pressure to the wound. Hold pressure continuously for 10-15 minutes. Do not peek or lift the cloth to check progress; doing so disrupts the clotting process.
*   **Elevate:** If possible, raise the injured limb above the heart.
*   **Add More Dressing:** If blood soaks through the first cloth, apply another on top. Do not remove the first cloth.
*   **Tourniquet (If Necessary):** Only use a tourniquet as a last resort for severe, life-threatening bleeding in a limb that cannot be controlled by other means.  Apply 2-3 inches above the wound, tighten until bleeding stops, and clearly mark the time of application. Seek immediate medical attention.
*   **Clean the Wound:** Once bleeding is controlled, gently clean the area around the wound with mild soap and water. Be careful not to scrub the wound itself.
*   **Apply Antibiotic Ointment:** Apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment to help prevent infection. (If allergy is not present)
