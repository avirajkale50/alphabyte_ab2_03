## First Aid Guide: Conjunctivitis (Pink Eye)

This guide provides information on first aid for conjunctivitis, commonly known as pink eye. It is intended for informational purposes only and does not substitute professional medical advice. Always consult a qualified healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment.

**1. Definition and Symptoms**

Conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the conjunctiva, the clear membrane that covers the white part of the eye and the inside of the eyelids. It can be caused by viral, bacterial, or allergic reactions.

*   **Viral Conjunctivitis:** Often associated with a common cold or respiratory infection. Highly contagious.
*   **Bacterial Conjunctivitis:** Can be caused by various bacteria and is also highly contagious.
*   **Allergic Conjunctivitis:** Triggered by allergens such as pollen, dust mites, or pet dander. Not contagious.

**Common Symptoms:**

*   **Redness:** In one or both eyes.
*   **Itching:** Often intense, especially with allergic conjunctivitis.
*   **Burning:** A gritty sensation in the eye.
*   **Watery discharge:** Common with viral and allergic conjunctivitis.
*   **Thick, yellow or green discharge:** More indicative of bacterial conjunctivitis. May cause eyelids to stick together, especially upon waking.
*   **Blurred vision:** Usually temporary and clears with blinking or cleaning.
*   **Swollen eyelids:** More common in allergic conjunctivitis.
*   **Increased sensitivity to light (photophobia):** Can occur with any type of conjunctivitis.
*   **Crusting:** Around the eyelids, especially after sleep.

**2. When to Seek Emergency Medical Help**

While most cases of conjunctivitis are mild and resolve on their own or with simple treatment, seek immediate medical attention if any of the following symptoms are present:

*   **Severe eye pain.**
*   **Vision loss or significant blurring of vision that does not clear with blinking.**
*   **Sensitivity to light (photophobia) so intense that it interferes with daily activities.**
*   **Intense redness around the eye, spreading beyond the conjunctiva.**
*   **High fever.**
*   **Inability to keep the eye open.**
*   **Suspected chemical burn to the eye.**
*   **Recent eye injury.**
*   **If the person is an infant (under 1 month old).** Eye infections in newborns require immediate evaluation.
*   **Weakened immune system (e.g., due to HIV, cancer treatment, or organ transplant).**
*   **You wear contact lenses and experience severe eye pain or vision changes.**
*   **Symptoms worsen or do not improve after a few days of home care.**

**3. Step-by-Step First Aid Procedures**

*   **Isolate the affected individual:** Viral and bacterial conjunctivitis are highly contagious.  Limit close contact until a diagnosis is confirmed and treatment is initiated, if necessary.

*   **Wash Hands Thoroughly:** Before and after touching or cleaning the affected eye(s). Use soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.  Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.

*   **Clean the Eye(s) Gently:**

    *   **Materials:** Use clean cotton balls or washcloths.
    *   **Procedure:**
        *   Gently wipe the eyelids and lashes to remove any discharge or crusting.
        *   Wipe from the inner corner of the eye (near the nose) outwards.
        *   Use a separate clean cotton ball or washcloth for each eye to prevent spreading infection.
        *   **Do not** reuse the same cotton ball or washcloth for the other eye, even if only one eye is currently affected.

*   **Apply Cool or Warm Compresses:**

    *   **Procedure:**
        *   Soak a clean washcloth in cool or warm water (not hot).
        *   Wring out excess water.
        *   Gently apply the compress to the affected eye(s) for 5-10 minutes.
        *   Repeat several times a day to soothe irritation.
        *   Use a clean washcloth each time.
        *   **Caution:**  Avoid using hot compresses, as they can worsen inflammation.

*   **Pain Relief:**

    *   Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can be used to manage discomfort, following package instructions.

**4. Home Remedies and Self-Care Tips**

*   **Avoid Touching or Rubbing Your Eyes:** This can worsen the condition and spread the infection.
*   **Do Not Share Personal Items:** This includes towels, washcloths, eye drops, eye makeup, and contact lenses.
*   **Use Artificial Tears:** Over-the-counter artificial tears can help lubricate the eye and relieve discomfort.
*   **Remove Contact Lenses:** If you wear contact lenses, remove them immediately and do not wear them again until your symptoms have completely resolved and your doctor advises it is safe to do so. Discard disposable lenses. Clean and disinfect reusable lenses thoroughly according to your eye doctor's instructions. It may be preferable to discard them as well.
*   **Avoid Eye Makeup:** Refrain from wearing eye makeup until the infection has cleared. Replace all eye makeup that was used while you had conjunctivitis to prevent reinfection.
*   **Increase Air Circulation:** Use a humidifier to keep the air moist, especially in dry environments.
*   **Rest:** Get adequate rest to help your body fight the infection.
*   **Saline Wash (for Allergic Conjunctivitis):** Mix 1/4 teaspoon of salt in 1 cup of distilled or sterile water. Use a clean syringe or eyedropper to gently flush the eye with the saline solution. This helps to remove allergens.
*   **Consult a healthcare professional:** To confirm diagnosis and possible prescription medication needs, if bacterial.

**5. Prevention Measures**

*   **Frequent Handwashing:** Wash hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water, especially after touching your eyes or face.
*   **Avoid Touching Your Eyes:** Be mindful of touching your eyes, especially in public places.
*   **Use Clean Towels and Washcloths:** Avoid sharing towels and washcloths with others.
*   **Change Pillowcases Regularly:** Change pillowcases daily when infected.
*   **Avoid Sharing Eye Makeup and Cosmetics:** Never share eye makeup or cosmetics with others. Discard makeup if you have had conjunctivitis.
*   **Proper Contact Lens Care:** Follow your eye doctor's instructions for cleaning and disinfecting contact lenses. Replace contact lenses as recommended.
*   **Avoid Known Allergens:** If you have allergic conjunctivitis, try to avoid the allergens that trigger your symptoms (e.g., pollen, dust mites, pet dander).
*   **Stay Home When Contagious:** If you have viral or bacterial conjunctivitis, stay home from school or work until your symptoms have resolved or your doctor has cleared you.
*   **Avoid Swimming Pools:** Chlorinated water can irritate conjunctivitis.
*   **Safe Practices When Using Eyedrops** Avoid touching the dropper tip to your eye or other surfaces to prevent contamination of the eyedrop bottle.
*   **Good hygiene practices at schools and daycare facilities:** Regularly disinfect surfaces, promote handwashing, and isolate affected individuals.
