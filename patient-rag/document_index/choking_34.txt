## First Aid Guide: Choking

This guide provides information on recognizing and responding to choking emergencies. It is not a substitute for formal first aid training. Always seek professional medical help when necessary.

**1. Definition and Symptoms:**

*   **Definition:** Choking occurs when a foreign object blocks the airway, preventing air from entering the lungs. This can be a partial or complete blockage.
*   **Symptoms:** The symptoms vary depending on the severity of the blockage:

    *   **Mild (Partial) Airway Obstruction:**
        *   Coughing forcefully.
        *   Gagging.
        *   Wheezing or making high-pitched sounds while breathing.
        *   Ability to speak or make some noise.
    *   **Severe (Complete) Airway Obstruction:**
        *   Inability to speak, cough, or breathe.
        *   Clutching at the throat (universal choking sign).
        *   Bluish discoloration of the skin (cyanosis), particularly around the lips and fingernails.
        *   Loss of consciousness.
        *   Gasping for air.
        *   Panic.

**2. When to Seek Emergency Medical Help (Call Emergency Services â€“ 911 or your local equivalent):**

*   **Immediately** if the person becomes unconscious.
*   If abdominal thrusts or back blows are ineffective.
*   If the person has a known medical condition that could complicate choking (e.g., asthma, COPD).
*   If the person experiences prolonged coughing or difficulty breathing after the obstruction is removed. There may be damage to the airway.
*   If you are unable to dislodge the object on your own or for another person.

**3. Step-by-Step First Aid Procedures:**

**A. Conscious Adult or Child (over 1 year old):**

    *   **Assess:** Determine if the person is truly choking (unable to speak, cough, or breathe effectively).
    *   **Encourage Coughing (Mild Obstruction):** If the person is coughing forcefully, encourage them to continue coughing. Do not interfere unless they stop coughing effectively.
    *   **Back Blows:** If coughing is ineffective or the obstruction is severe:
        1.  Stand slightly behind the person. Support their chest with one hand.
        2.  Lean the person forward so that the object can exit the mouth rather than go further down.
        3.  Give five firm back blows between the shoulder blades with the heel of your other hand.
        4.  Check to see if the obstruction has cleared.
    *   **Abdominal Thrusts (Heimlich Maneuver):** If back blows are ineffective:
        1.  Stand behind the person.
        2.  Wrap your arms around the person's waist.
        3.  Make a fist with one hand and place the thumb side against the person's abdomen, slightly above the navel and below the rib cage.
        4.  Grasp your fist with your other hand and give five quick, upward thrusts into the abdomen.
        5.  Check to see if the obstruction has cleared.
    *   **Alternate:** Continue alternating between five back blows and five abdominal thrusts until the object is dislodged or the person becomes unconscious.

**B. Conscious Infant (under 1 year old):**

    *   **Assess:** Determine if the infant is truly choking (unable to cry, cough, or breathe effectively).
    *   **Back Blows:**
        1.  Hold the infant face down along your forearm, supporting the head and jaw with your hand. Rest your forearm on your thigh for support.
        2.  Give five firm back blows between the shoulder blades with the heel of your other hand.
        3.  Check to see if the obstruction has cleared.
    *   **Chest Thrusts:**
        1.  If back blows are ineffective, turn the infant face up, supporting the head and neck. Rest your forearm on your thigh.
        2.  Place two fingers (index and middle finger) on the breastbone, just below the nipple line.
        3.  Give five quick chest thrusts, compressing the chest about 1.5 inches.
        4.  Check to see if the obstruction has cleared.
    *   **Alternate:** Continue alternating between five back blows and five chest thrusts until the object is dislodged or the infant becomes unconscious.

**C. Unconscious Adult, Child, or Infant:**

    *   **Call Emergency Services (911 or your local equivalent) immediately if you have not already done so.**
    *   **Lower the person gently to the floor.**
    *   **Begin CPR:**
        *   Check for breathing. If no breathing, begin chest compressions:
            *   **Adult/Child:** 30 chest compressions followed by 2 rescue breaths.  Compress the chest about 2 inches (5 cm) deep at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute.
            *   **Infant:** 30 chest compressions followed by 2 rescue breaths.  Compress the chest about 1.5 inches (4 cm) deep at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. Use two fingers on the breastbone just below the nipple line.
        *   **Check the mouth for the object:** Before giving breaths, look in the mouth for the obstructing object. If visible and easily removable, carefully sweep it out with your finger. Do not perform blind finger sweeps.
        *   **Continue CPR until emergency help arrives.** Repeat compressions, checking for the object in the mouth, and attempt rescue breaths between compressions.

**D. Choking When Alone (Self-Treatment):**

*   **Heimlich Maneuver on Yourself:**
    *   Make a fist with one hand and place the thumb side against your abdomen, slightly above the navel and below the rib cage.
    *   Grasp your fist with your other hand and give quick, upward thrusts into your abdomen.
*   **Using a Chair or Table Edge:**
    *   Lean over the edge of a chair or table and thrust your abdomen forcefully against the edge.

**4. Home Remedies and Self-Care Tips (After the Obstruction is Removed):**

*   **Monitor Breathing:** Observe the person for any signs of respiratory distress.
*   **Seek Medical Evaluation:** It is advisable to seek medical evaluation even after the obstruction is removed, especially if the person experienced prolonged choking, coughing, or difficulty breathing afterwards. This helps rule out potential damage to the airway, such as aspiration pneumonia or tracheal injury.
*   **Soothe Throat:** Warm liquids and throat lozenges can help soothe the throat after a choking episode.
*   **Avoid Irritants:** Avoid smoking or exposure to irritants that could further irritate the airway.

**5. Prevention Measures:**

*   **Cut Food into Small Pieces:** Especially for young children and older adults.
*   **Chew Food Thoroughly:** Eat slowly and deliberately.
*   **Avoid Talking or Laughing While Eating:** This can increase the risk of aspiration.
*   **Supervise Children While Eating:** Pay close attention to what young children are putting in their mouths.
*   **Keep Small Objects Out of Reach of Children:** Be mindful of potential choking hazards like small toys, coins, buttons, and balloons.
*   **Consider Meal Modifications:** Modify the diet and texture of food for individuals with swallowing difficulties (dysphagia).
*   **Avoid Excessive Alcohol Consumption:** Alcohol can impair swallowing reflexes.
*   **Teach Choking First Aid:** Educate yourself and others on how to recognize and respond to choking emergencies.
*   **Proper Denture Fit:** Ensure dentures fit properly to facilitate proper chewing and prevent swallowing difficulties.
*   **Be Mindful of Medications:** Some medications can cause drowsiness or impaired reflexes, increasing the risk of choking.
* **Know CPR:** Maintain current certification in CPR, which includes techniques for managing choking emergencies.
