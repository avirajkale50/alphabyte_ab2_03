## First Aid Guide: Allergies

**1. Definition and Symptoms**

An allergy is a hypersensitivity reaction of the immune system to a normally harmless substance called an allergen. When exposed to the allergen, the body produces antibodies, leading to the release of histamine and other chemicals, causing a variety of symptoms.

**Symptoms vary depending on the allergen and the individual, but common reactions include:**

*   **Skin Reactions:**
    *   Hives (urticaria): Itchy, raised welts on the skin.
    *   Eczema (atopic dermatitis): Dry, itchy, inflamed skin.
    *   Rash: General skin irritation or redness.
    *   Itching.
    *   Swelling (angioedema): Particularly of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.

*   **Respiratory Reactions:**
    *   Sneezing.
    *   Runny nose (rhinitis).
    *   Nasal congestion.
    *   Itchy, watery eyes (conjunctivitis).
    *   Coughing.
    *   Wheezing.
    *   Shortness of breath.
    *   Chest tightness.

*   **Gastrointestinal Reactions:**
    *   Nausea.
    *   Vomiting.
    *   Diarrhea.
    *   Abdominal pain or cramps.

*   **Systemic Reactions (Anaphylaxis):** A severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction affecting multiple body systems.  Symptoms can include:
    *   Difficulty breathing or wheezing.
    *   Swelling of the tongue or throat.
    *   Hoarseness.
    *   Dizziness or lightheadedness.
    *   Rapid heartbeat.
    *   Loss of consciousness.
    *   Drop in blood pressure.

**2. When to Seek Emergency Medical Help**

**IMMEDIATELY call emergency services (911 in the US and Canada, 111 in the UK, 000 in Australia, or the equivalent in your region) if any of the following signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis are present:**

*   Difficulty breathing or wheezing
*   Swelling of the tongue or throat
*   Hoarseness
*   Dizziness or lightheadedness
*   Rapid heartbeat
*   Loss of consciousness
*   Significant drop in blood pressure

**If someone is known to carry an epinephrine auto-injector (e.g., EpiPen), administer it IMMEDIATELY at the first sign of anaphylaxis and call for emergency services, even if symptoms appear to improve after injection.** The effects of epinephrine can wear off, and further medical care is necessary.

**Seek prompt medical attention for:**

*   Severe allergic reactions that don't involve anaphylaxis, but are causing significant distress.
*   Allergic reactions that don't improve with over-the-counter medications.
*   Allergic reactions that are accompanied by fever.
*   Allergic reactions that are affecting the person's ability to function normally.

**3. Step-by-Step First Aid Procedures**

**For Mild to Moderate Allergic Reactions (No Anaphylaxis):**

1.  **Identify and Remove the Allergen:** This is the most crucial step.  Stop exposure to the suspected allergen immediately.
2.  **Monitor Breathing and Airway:** Ensure the person is breathing adequately. Watch for signs of difficulty breathing.
3.  **Administer Antihistamines:** Over-the-counter antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine [Benadryl], loratadine [Claritin], cetirizine [Zyrtec], fexofenadine [Allegra]) can help reduce itching, hives, and other mild symptoms.  Follow dosage instructions carefully, paying attention to age and weight.  Note that diphenhydramine can cause drowsiness.
4.  **Apply Calamine Lotion or Hydrocortisone Cream:** For localized skin reactions like hives or rash, apply calamine lotion or 1% hydrocortisone cream to relieve itching.
5.  **Cool Compress:** Apply a cool compress to the affected area to reduce swelling and itching.
6.  **Monitor Symptoms:** Observe the person for worsening symptoms or signs of anaphylaxis.

**For Anaphylaxis:**

1.  **Recognize Anaphylaxis:** Be aware of the signs and symptoms (see above).
2.  **Administer Epinephrine:** If the person has an epinephrine auto-injector, administer it immediately.
    *   Remove the auto-injector from its carrier tube.
    *   Follow the specific instructions provided by the manufacturer (different auto-injectors may have slightly different procedures). Generally, this involves:
        *   Removing the safety cap.
        *   Pressing the injector firmly against the outer thigh (mid-thigh, not over a joint or bone) until it clicks.
        *   Holding the injector in place for the recommended duration (usually 3-10 seconds).
        *   Remove the injector and massage the injection site for a few seconds.
    *   **Administer a second dose of epinephrine if symptoms do not improve within 5-15 minutes, or if symptoms return before emergency medical help arrives.**  If available, use a second auto-injector.
3.  **Call Emergency Services (911 or equivalent):**  Call emergency services immediately, even after administering epinephrine.  Inform the dispatcher that the person is experiencing anaphylaxis and has received epinephrine.
4.  **Position the Person:**
    *   If the person is conscious and breathing normally, have them lie down with their legs elevated. This can help maintain blood pressure.
    *   If the person is having difficulty breathing, allow them to sit up in a comfortable position.
    *   If the person is unconscious and breathing, place them in the recovery position (on their side with their head tilted back to maintain an open airway).
    *   If the person is not breathing, begin CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) if you are trained to do so.
5.  **Monitor Vital Signs:** Continue to monitor the person's breathing, pulse, and level of consciousness until emergency medical personnel arrive.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on medication labels carefully.
*   Be aware of any known allergies of the person.
*   If you are unsure about the severity of the reaction, err on the side of caution and seek medical attention.
*   Inform emergency medical personnel about any medications the person has taken, including antihistamines and epinephrine.

**4. Home Remedies and Self-Care Tips (For Mild Allergies):**

These remedies are for mild allergic reactions only and should not be used in place of medical treatment for severe reactions.

*   **Avoidance:** The most effective home remedy is avoiding the allergen.
*   **Saline Nasal Rinse:** For nasal allergies, use a saline nasal rinse to clear nasal passages and relieve congestion.
*   **Cool Shower or Bath:** Can help soothe itchy skin. Avoid hot water, which can worsen itching.
*   **Oatmeal Bath:** Colloidal oatmeal added to a bath can relieve itchy skin.
*   **Emollients:** Apply fragrance-free emollients (moisturizers) to dry, irritated skin.
*   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated.
*   **Neti Pot:** A neti pot can be used to rinse nasal passages and relieve congestion. Use distilled or sterile water.
*   **Identify and document triggers:** keeping a journal of potential triggers can help with identifying and mitigating future reactions.

**5. Prevention Measures**

*   **Allergy Testing:** Undergo allergy testing to identify specific allergens.
*   **Avoidance:** Avoid exposure to known allergens.
    *   Read food labels carefully.
    *   Be aware of potential cross-contamination.
    *   Use air purifiers with HEPA filters to remove allergens from the air.
    *   Wear protective clothing when exposed to allergens (e.g., gloves when gardening).
    *   Consider allergy shots (immunotherapy) if avoidance is difficult.
*   **Inform Others:** Inform family, friends, teachers, and caregivers about allergies.
*   **Carry Epinephrine:** If at risk for anaphylaxis, carry an epinephrine auto-injector at all times and know how to use it. Ensure it is not expired. Train others how to administer the injection.
*   **Medical Identification:** Wear a medical identification bracelet or necklace indicating allergies.
*   **Allergy Action Plan:** Develop a written allergy action plan with a healthcare provider and share it with relevant individuals.
*   **Medication Management:** Follow your doctor's recommendations for allergy medication.
