*   **Shortness of breath (dyspnea)**
*   **Sweating (diaphoresis)**
*   **Nausea or vomiting**
*   **Dizziness or lightheadedness**
*   **Rapid or irregular heartbeat (palpitations)**
*   **Anxiety or a feeling of impending doom**

*   **Pain aggravated by movement or breathing**

**Possible Causes:** Chest pain has numerous potential causes, ranging from benign to life-threatening. Some common causes include:

*   **Cardiac (Heart-related):** Angina, Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack), Pericarditis, Aortic Dissection.
*   **Pulmonary (Lung-related):** Pneumonia, Pleurisy, Pulmonary Embolism, Pneumothorax.

**2. When to Seek Emergency Medical Help**

**IMMEDIATELY CALL EMERGENCY SERVICES (e.g., 911 in the US, 112 in Europe, 000 in Australia) if chest pain:**

*   Is **sudden and severe**
*   Feels like **pressure, squeezing, or crushing** in the chest
*   Is **accompanied by shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or lightheadedness**
*   **Radiates to the arm, shoulder, neck, jaw, or back**
*   Is **associated with a loss of consciousness**
*   Occurs in a person with a **known history of heart problems**
*   Is **persistent and unexplained**
*   Follows a **significant injury**
*   Is present with **known risk factors for heart disease (smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, family history)**

**Do not delay seeking help while attempting to self-diagnose or self-treat.** Time is critical in cases of heart attack and other life-threatening conditions.

**3. Step-by-Step First Aid Procedures**

The following steps are for individuals awaiting emergency medical assistance. They do not replace professional medical intervention.

*   **Ensure Safety:** Ensure the environment is safe for both the person experiencing chest pain and the first aider.
*   **Call for Help:** Immediately call emergency services. Clearly state the location, the nature of the problem (chest pain), and any other relevant symptoms. Provide the age and gender of the person if possible.
*   **Keep the Person Calm:** Reassure the person and encourage them to remain calm. Anxiety can worsen the symptoms.
*   **Position the Person Comfortably:** Help the person sit or lie down in a comfortable position. Often, sitting upright with support is preferred. Loosen any tight clothing around the neck and chest.
*   **Monitor Vital Signs:** If possible, monitor the person's breathing, pulse, and level of consciousness until emergency services arrive.
*   **Administer Medication (If Applicable):**
    *   **Nitroglycerin:** If the person has a known history of angina and has been prescribed nitroglycerin, assist them in taking it as directed by their physician. Remind them not to take Viagra, Cialis, Levitra or similar medications within 24-48 hours of Nitroglycerin as the combination could cause dangerously low blood pressure.
    *   **Aspirin:** If the person is not allergic to aspirin and has no other contraindications (e.g., bleeding disorder, ulcer), have them chew and swallow one adult-strength (325 mg) or four low-dose (81 mg) aspirin tablets. Aspirin can help prevent further blood clot formation in a heart attack. **Consult emergency services for advice on aspirin administration.**
*   **CPR (If Necessary):** If the person becomes unresponsive and stops breathing, begin CPR immediately. If you are not trained in CPR, follow the dispatcher's instructions over the phone.
*   **Provide Information to Emergency Responders:** When emergency services arrive, provide them with a clear and concise account of the situation, including the person's symptoms, medical history (if known), medications, and any first aid provided.
