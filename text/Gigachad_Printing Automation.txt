ABSTRACT :  
 
Printing services in educational institutions and public centers often face 
inefficiencies, such as long queues, misplaced or mixed-up prints, incorrect copies, 
and resource wastage. Traditionally, staff at Xerox centers manually download 
PDFs and print them, creating bottlenecks and opportunities for error. These issues 
lead to frustration for customers and increased operational overhead for Xerox 
centers.To address these challenges, we propose an automated printing system that 
eliminates manual processing by allowing users to log in, upload documents, and 
specify printing preferences (copies, duplex, color/BW) through a web portal or 
WhatsApp integration. The request is directly sent to a local server-based queuing 
mechanism on the Xerox shop's PC, which dynamically assigns print jobs to 
available printers without a middleman.At the Xerox center, a desktop interface 
continuously monitors printer availability and automates print execution, reducing 
delays and human errors. Additionally, users can opt for stapling or punching, with 
printed guide dots facilitating manual finishing. To enhance accessibility in India, 
our system integrates WhatsApp as a user-friendly medium for submitting print 
jobs, ensuring easy handling while maintaining privacy and security.Furthermore, 
to prevent network-related interruptions in crowded areas like colleges during file 
uploads, users can gain temporary access to a private WiFi network by scanning a 
QR code, providing reliable internet connectivity for the duration of their 
transaction.
